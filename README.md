# Parental Companion

An Android parental control solution with two applications - one for parents and another for children's devices.

## Overview

Parental Companion is a comprehensive parental control system that allows parents to monitor and manage their children's device usage remotely. The system consists of two Android applications built with MVVM architecture in Kotlin.

## Features

### Parent App Features
- **Dashboard**: View real-time status of child device
- **Screen Time Control**: Set daily screen time limits
- **App Usage Management**: Block or allow specific apps
- **Contact Management**: Control which contacts the child can communicate with
- **Location Tracking**: Real-time location tracking of child device
- **Geofencing**: Create safe zones and get notifications when child enters/exits
- **Device Locking**: Remotely lock/unlock child device

### Child App Features
- **Monitoring Service**: Runs as a foreground service to enforce parental controls
- **Screen Time Enforcement**: Automatically locks device when time limit is exceeded
- **App Blocking**: Prevents blocked apps from running
- **Contact Filtering**: Restricts communication to allowed contacts only
- **Location Sharing**: Shares device location with parent
- **Geofencing**: Monitors geofence boundaries and sends alerts
- **Device Lock**: Enforces device lock when requested by parent

## Architecture

Both applications follow the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern:

```
app/
├── data/
│   ├── model/          # Data models
│   ├── repository/     # Data repositories
│   ├── local/          # Local data sources (Room DB)
│   └── remote/         # Remote data sources (Firebase)
├── ui/                 # UI layer (Activities, Fragments)
│   ├── dashboard/      # Dashboard feature
│   ├── screentime/     # Screen time feature
│   ├── appcontrol/     # App control feature
│   ├── contacts/       # Contact management feature
│   ├── location/       # Location tracking feature
│   └── devicelock/     # Device lock feature
├── service/            # Background services
└── utils/              # Utility classes
```

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Kotlin
- **Architecture**: MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- **UI**: Material Design Components, View Binding, Data Binding
- **Navigation**: Navigation Component
- **Dependency Injection**: Manual DI (can be upgraded to Hilt/Koin)
- **Database**: Room (for local storage)
- **Backend**: Firebase Realtime Database
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Messaging**: Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Location**: Google Play Services Location API
- **Coroutines**: For asynchronous operations
- **LiveData/Flow**: For reactive data streams

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- JDK 17
- Android SDK with minimum API level 24
- Firebase project setup

### Firebase Setup

Firebase is **required** for this project to enable real-time communication between parent and child devices.

**📖 For detailed Firebase setup instructions, see [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md)**

Quick overview:
1. Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Add two Android apps to your Firebase project:
   - Parent app: `com.parentalcompanion.parent`
   - Child app: `com.parentalcompanion.child`
3. Download `google-services.json` for each app
4. Replace the placeholder `google-services.json` files in:
   - `parent-app/google-services.json`
   - `child-app/google-services.json`
5. Enable Firebase Realtime Database
6. Configure Firebase Security Rules
7. Enable Firebase Cloud Messaging (automatically enabled)

The [FIREBASE_SETUP.md](FIREBASE_SETUP.md) guide includes:
- Step-by-step instructions with screenshots
- Security rules configuration
- Troubleshooting common issues
- Production deployment considerations

### Building the Apps

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SharksJio/parentalCompanion.git
cd parentalCompanion
```

2. Open the project in Android Studio

3. Sync Gradle files

4. Build the Parent app:
```bash
./gradlew :parent-app:assembleDebug
```

5. Build the Child app:
```bash
./gradlew :child-app:assembleDebug
```

### Installation

1. Install Parent app on parent's device:
```bash
adb install parent-app/build/outputs/apk/debug/parent-app-debug.apk
```

2. Install Child app on child's device:
```bash
adb install child-app/build/outputs/apk/debug/child-app-debug.apk
```

## Permissions

### Parent App Permissions
- `INTERNET`: For Firebase communication
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: For viewing child's location
- `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`: For geofencing
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS`: For receiving notifications

### Child App Permissions
- `INTERNET`: For Firebase communication
- `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`: For location sharing
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE`: For monitoring service
- `PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS`: For app usage monitoring
- `READ_CONTACTS`: For contact filtering
- `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW`: For lock screen overlay
- `REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS`: To prevent service termination

```

## Security Considerations

- All Firebase communication is encrypted
- Implement proper Firebase Security Rules
- Use Firebase Authentication for user management
- Consider implementing end-to-end encryption for sensitive data
- Follow Android security best practices
- Request only necessary permissions
- Store sensitive data securely using Android Keystore

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Web dashboard for parents
- [ ] Multiple child device support
- [ ] Screen content monitoring
- [ ] Website filtering
- [ ] Scheduled restrictions
- [ ] Emergency SOS feature
- [ ] Activity reports and analytics
- [ ] Cross-platform support (iOS)
