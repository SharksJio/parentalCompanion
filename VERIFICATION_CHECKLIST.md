## Functionality Verification üîç

### Device-Level Screen Time (Pre-existing)
- [ ] Parent can set daily device time limit
- [ ] Child app tracks total screen time usage
- [ ] Usage updates every minute in Firebase
- [ ] Parent app displays current usage
- [ ] Device locks when limit exceeded

### Per-App Screen Time (Newly Implemented)
- [ ] Parent can set per-app time limits
- [ ] Child app observes app time limits
- [ ] Child app tracks per-app usage
- [ ] Per-app usage updates to Firebase
- [ ] Parent app displays per-app usage
- [ ] App redirects to home when limit exceeded

### UI/UX
- [ ] Parent app displays list of apps
- [ ] Usage time shown in hours and minutes
- [ ] Time limit input accepts minutes
- [ ] Block/unblock toggle works
- [ ] Tab filtering works (Allowed/Blocked)
- [ ] Toast notifications appear on actions
- [ ] Real-time updates from Firebase

### Data Flow
- [ ] Parent ‚Üí Firebase: Time limit set
- [ ] Firebase ‚Üí Child: Limit received
- [ ] Child ‚Üí Firebase: Usage updated
- [ ] Firebase ‚Üí Parent: Usage displayed

## Security & Performance ‚úì

### Security
- [x] No sensitive data exposed
- [x] Firebase encryption used
- [x] No SQL injection risks

- [x] No memory leaks in service
- [x] Proper lifecycle management
- [x] Battery impact minimized

## Edge Cases üß™

### To Test
- [ ] What happens when usage is at exactly the limit?
- [ ] What happens when limit is set to 0?
- [ ] What happens when Firebase is offline?
- [ ] What happens when service is killed?
- [ ] What happens at midnight (usage reset)?
- [ ] What happens when multiple apps are controlled?
- [ ] What happens when permission is revoked?

## Known Limitations üìù

### Android Limitations
- ‚úì Requires PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS permission (manual grant)
- ‚úì UsageStatsManager has slight delays
- ‚úì Statistics reset at midnight
- ‚úì Sleep time not counted as usage

### Implementation Limitations

### Required Manual Testing
Since this is an Android app requiring specific hardware:

1. **Device Setup**
   - [ ] Install child app on test device
   - [ ] Install parent app on parent device
   - [ ] Grant PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS permission on child device
   - [ ] Grant screen overlay permission on child device
   - [ ] Ensure both devices have internet connection

2. **Firebase Setup**
   - [ ] Firebase project is configured
   - [ ] Both apps have google-services.json
   - [ ] Firebase Realtime Database is enabled
   - [ ] Security rules are configured

3. **Device-Level Testing**
   - [ ] Set device limit in parent app
   - [ ] Verify limit appears in Firebase
   - [ ] Use child device normally
   - [ ] Verify usage updates in parent app
   - [ ] Verify lock screen appears at limit

4. **Per-App Testing**
   - [ ] Set app limit in parent app
   - [ ] Verify limit appears in Firebase
   - [ ] Use specific app on child device
   - [ ] Verify app usage updates in parent app
   - [ ] Verify app is blocked at limit

5. **UI Testing**
   - [ ] Verify parent app displays apps correctly
   - [ ] Verify usage times display correctly
   - [ ] Verify time limit input works
   - [ ] Verify block/unblock toggle works
   - [ ] Verify tab filtering works
